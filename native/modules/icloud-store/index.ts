// The whole native surface this wrapper adds is a small file store: list,
// read, write, remove, inside the app's own iCloud Drive container. iCloud
// does the syncing; nothing here merges, diffs, or interprets a byte. The web
// app drives it through the framework's ordinary storage-adapter contract, the
// same way it drives a picked local folder.
//
// APPLE ONLY. iCloud has no Android equivalent, so the module declares only
// the `apple` platform and `requireOptionalNativeModule` returns `null`
// everywhere else — an Android build, Expo Go, a bare `expo start`. The
// wrapper then reports the backend as unavailable and the web app hides it,
// rather than crashing at import.
