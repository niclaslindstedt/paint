// THE iCLOUD BRIDGE: how the page reads and writes the app's iCloud Drive
// container.
//
// The web app never learns it is running inside this wrapper. What it does is
// look for an iCLOUD PROVIDER on `window` — a capability, not an identity —
// and this is the script that installs one (see `src/app/icloudHost.ts` for
// the other side of the contract). A browser has no such provider and the
// whole backend, down to its entry in the Storage picker, simply is not there.
//
// `react-native-webview` gives us one message channel in each direction: the
// page posts strings out, and the app injects scripts in. That is enough for
// request/response as long as each call carries an id, so this module is:
//
//   • a script that defines `window.__paintICloud`, whose methods post a
//     request out and return a promise;
//   • `isICloudRequest`, which narrows an inbound message; and
//   • `resolveScript`, which builds the one line of JavaScript that settles
//     the promise back in the page.
//
// The wrapper decides nothing about the drawings. It moves opaque files
// between the page and a folder in iCloud Drive: which file the document lives
// in, how images and layers are filed beside it, what a conflict means and
// when a save is due are all the web app's, in `src/app/useSyncEngine.ts`
// against the framework's storage adapters. A wrapper that parsed a drawing
// would be a second implementation of the app's domain.
//
// Like `injected.ts`, this file exports STRINGS. Keep the page-side code
// dependency-free and ES5-ish — it runs in the WebView, not in Metro's bundle,
// so nothing in it is transpiled or polyfilled.

// From `icloudWire.ts`, NOT from `icloud.ts`: this module is pure and is
// exercised by the root test suite, which runs against an install that has no
// `expo` in it. Importing the types from their reader — even as a type-only
// import — puts the native module back in the root's type graph and turns CI
// red on a machine where it passes.
