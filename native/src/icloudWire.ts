// WHAT CROSSES THE iCLOUD BRIDGE — the shapes, and nothing that can reach
// iCloud.
//
// This module exists to stay IMPORT-FREE, and that is its whole job. The root
// `tsc` type-checks `tests/`, `tests/native_icloud_test.ts` imports
// `icloudBridge.ts`, and a root `npm ci` does not install `native/`'s own
// dependencies — so anything reachable from that test which imports `expo`
// turns a fully-installed machine green and CI red. (Same trap as
// `native/tsconfig.json` not extending Expo's base; see `AGENTS.md`.)
//
// So `icloudBridge.ts` — pure, and exercised from the root suite — takes its
// types from here, and only `icloud.ts` reaches for the native module. Nothing
// in the root's type graph reaches it at all.
//
// The types below MIRROR `src/app/icloudHost.ts`'s rather than importing them:
// `native/` is a separate npm project and reaching across would make the
// wrapper's typecheck depend on the web app's module resolution.
// `tests/native_icloud_test.ts` is what keeps the two honest.
